REQUIREMENTS: 
SoundHandler Lib
# git clone git@github.com:emil10001/SoundHandler.git
File Explorer android-file-dialog
# svn checkout http://android-file-dialog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ android-file-dialog-read-only

Basically, this is just a way to test the functionality of SoundHandler on a device. It is very basic, just gives a few buttons and a couple status messages. It streams a test sound file from my server. Also allows user to select a file from the filesystem to play instead. Buttons 1, 2 and 3 are sound effects.

Added ability to select an audio file from /sdcard.
